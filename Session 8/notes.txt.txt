3. Installing Bootstrap (from Bootstrap's Ddocumentation)
	Downloading all the files into a vendor folder is not required, but is a common pattern.
	<link> and <script> is fastest way to get started
	Included code:
		bootstrap.css
		bootstrap-grid.css
		bootstrap-utilities.css
		bootstrap-reboot.css

		bootstrap.bundle.js
		bootstrap.js
	Minified versions of these files are used in prod, while the full file is usually used in development
4. Browsers and Devices
	Latest stable versions of all major browsers
	Old browsers supported as well with CSS hacks that throw validation errors/warnings
	Bootstap's JS is NOT compatible with React/Vue/Angular's JS
		packages available for these frameworks
5. Accessibility
	Out-of-the-box accessible - if you use the HTML markup correctly
	Colour contrast passes  WCAG 2.1 text color contrast ratio of 4.5:1 and the WCAG 2.1 non-text color contrast ratio of 3:1)
	Interactive components work with assistive tech and have ARIA roles already assigned to them.
6. Bootstrap resizes things based on RFS mixin, mixins are managed by Sass. 
7. You can customize bootstrap properties 2 ways:

		<body class="container"> most of the time
		Containers center and horizontally pad your content
	Grid
		12 columns per row
		6 breakpoints
