/* static - absolute units of measurement (px), would not grow or shrink with the screens, mostly landscape screen orientation
fluid - relative units of measurement (%), would grow and shrink for most screens, mostly landscape screen orientation (would not work on mobile very well)
adaptive - URLs like "m.facebook.com" with the 'm.' prefix. Could still use fluid measurements.
responsive - adaptive + fluid in ONE webpage. No longer need seperate web page. Instead we need seperate styles.
mobile-first responsive - same as above, but design for the phones FIRST. Aka Progressive design */
